         <h2 id="perception"> From The Grammy's To Gag City: How Media and Perception affect black female rappers</h2>
         <p class="gag">Nicki Minaj is often seen as a legend in her own right. 
            She kicked in the door that was unlocked for her to open by her predecessors. 
            Her creativity and flow within the scene was something new and exciting that many could endorse and support. 
            Female rappers like Doja Cat have stated Nicki Minaj as her direct inspiration with many songs paying homage to her in some capacity. 
            Especially in “Get into it Yuh” where she emulates a flow Nicki Minaj had used in the past with the song “Massive Attack” (Chris Mench, 2021). 
            However, over the years with multiple different controversies with many having to do with her own body, she has transformed from an icon into someone who is nearly a caricature of themself. 
            The media has taken issues with her body since the moment she started on the scene and these are issues that she has internalized to the point of no return. She fell into the same trap that Lil Kim, her predecessor, fell into years prior where the highlight in the media along with her overall abusive relationship turned her own thoughts into poison to the point where she looks physically unrecognizable. 
            The playlist that I created for this project is listened to in order of the eras at which they were recorded. 
            There is something that can be described in her current songs compared to her previous. 
            The metaphorical light in her voice is gone. 
            While you can attribute this to aging, there are recordings and songs where she sounds like she cannot do it anymore but she must prove that she cannot be beaten. 
            In her song, “Still I rise”, she states “Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz”. This song was released in 2009 on her major mixtape, “Beam Me Up Scotty”  where she had not seen as much commercial success as she would in the future with “Pink Friday” releasing a year later. 
            Even though she discusses her haters, it is not until “Anaconda” is released where there is major controversy. 
            One she cannot control; a controversy on her own body. 
            While she had surgery to enhance her butt during this time and it was quite noticeable, she was posted against people with balloons in their pants to act like Nicki Minaj. 
            She was experiencing a phenomenon that was not uncommon to black female performers alike. 
            Her body was being ogled and gawked at as a show as she was entertaining them. 
            In, “Miley What’s Good”, Halliday discusses this phenomenon through the lens of Anaconda Feminism. 
            Anaconda feminism explores the relationship between black female celebrities who create spaces for Black female representation. 
            Through her music up until this point, she was vulnerable about her struggles, even in the album “PinkPrint” that Anaconda was released under, discussing her struggles with pills in the past and more of her emotional struggles. 
            However, the only takeaway at this time was the promotion for Anaconda along with the video that premiered where she was very sexual with a scene at the end with another rapper in Young Money, Drake, where she dances over him as he is seated. 
            She is showing off her sexuality in a very blunt manner. In her songs, she discusses sex but once sexual actions were shown, people had an issue with this. 
            The media struggles with seeing black women as sexual beings in the same fashion that it is ingrained in southern black women to be ashamed of their natural sexual urges. 
            In “Chronchling Stankonia”, Bradley discusses how in hip hop women are discussed in sexual acts but once they are taking control of their own sexual acts, there is an issue. 
            The media created an issue with something that was natural. Her body was ogled in the same fashion as Sarah Baartman who had a big butt and was captured and forced to live in a zoo for her entire life to be a form of entertainment for white people passing through. 
            This can be a main way at which the media consumes and spits her out. After controversy on controversy, she has turned into a vile and monstrous artist. A lot of the issues that she faced after Anaconda were orchestrating and participating in more beefs between other upcoming female artists. 
            Beefs in hip hop are typically fights between two artists and they “beef” back and forth by releasing diss tracks on each other. 
            She had been in beef prior to Remy Ma and Cardi B. The beef in question was with her own inspiration, Lil Kim, while it was dissolved and many blamed Lil Kim, it was soon shown that Nicki Minaj may have always been the problem. 
            The media is to blame in the beginning however, once we reach the beef with Megan Thee Stallion, it was her own overreactions that caused a lot of fans to begin to look at her own actions of the past. 
            Megan Thee Stallion is a trailblazer in her own right and suffered a lot of injustice within the music industry as well. 
            In the beginning, Nicki and Megan were collaborators who saw each other's art until Megan Thee Stallion was shot by Tory Lanez. 
            Many males in the music industry decided that she was framing an innocent black man and she suffered backlash for this. 
            This is another illustration of how the media can often turn on black rappers very quickly. 
            They are often used as entertainment but always ridiculed for things that cannot be controlled. 
            Once Megan was fed up with the ridicule, she released a song called “Hiss” where she indirectly called out all of her haters. 
            Instead of defending Megan or having any form of sympathy, Nicki Minaj decided to go on an Instagram Live for nearly 72 hours and frantically rant for hours about how Megan Thee Stallion attacked her family and no one should mess with her family. 
            She takes digs at Megan Thee Stallion’s traumatizing incident of her getting shot a year prior with the line “Glass Fragment foot ass bitch” and how she wanted to protect Tory Lanez initially causing many to deny that she was even shot in the first place. 
            This demonstration displayed that Nicki Minaj was not a woman who wanted to inspire or help other women anymore. 
            She had been ridiculed, pit against other females, and attacked for years until she finally broke and became someone who does not even make art that is recognizable with her old self. 
            She utilized her creativity to convey different themes and emotions with her videos and flow.
            Now, she utilizes that same creativity to make something hateful.
            Her latest album cover was created utilizing A.I. with her fans, Barbz, creating an A.I. city called “Gag City”. 
            Her latest album, Pink Friday 2, sold her lowest amount of units ever. Even her own fans were tired of her overall antics. 
            The media was something that once built her up but it turned into something that ridiculed her to no end and even destroyed her through the same media.
