                <p>
                    Nicki Minaj is often seen as a legend in her own right.
                    She kicked in the door that was unlocked for her to open by her predecessors. 
                    Her creativity and flow within the scene was something new and exciting that many could endorse and support.

                <h3> The Evolution of the 808 Beat</h3>
                <p>
                    It is a beat nearly as old as hip-hop itself. 
                    The 808 beat is a beat that is as classic as the songs that they are tied to. 
                    The 808 has been transformed into something that many different genres use to convey a specific sound but it has stayed overall synonymous with Hip-Hop.
